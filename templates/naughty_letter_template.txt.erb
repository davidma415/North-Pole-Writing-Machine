Dear <%= name.capitalize %>,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year.

I can forgive a lot but when you <%=infraction.join(" ")%> it was the last straw. If it were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list.

<% if toys.include?('Kaleidoscope') -%>
Unfortunately, Merton messed up the Kaleidoscope order and the shipment won’t arrive until January. We’re substituting your Kaleidoscope, with a picture of a whale.
<% else -%>
So you're getting the <%=gift%>. But I'm making sure it's from the defect pile.

As for the <%=rest_toys.join(", ")%> better luck next year.
<% end-%>
Remember – I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
