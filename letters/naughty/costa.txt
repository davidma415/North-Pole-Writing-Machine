Dear Costa,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year.

I can forgive a lot but when you pushed your sister off the roof it was the last straw. If it were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list.

So you're getting the Boat. But I'm making sure it's from the defect pile.

As for the Bear, Bicycle, Lego, Car, Blocks better luck next year.
Remember â€“ I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
