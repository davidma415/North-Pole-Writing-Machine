Dear Rory,

You must be very excited that Christmas is coming. Are you looking forward to getting lots of fun toys?

Are you? Seriously? C'mon kid.

I've been watching you all year.

I can forgive a lot but when you made pipe bombs and blew them up in forest it was the last straw. If it were up to me, you'd get nothing. In fact, I'd take back that Furby I got you last year. But Mrs. Claus insisted that I bring you something on your list.

Unfortunately, Merton messed up the Kaleidoscope order and the shipment won’t arrive until January. We’re substituting your Kaleidoscope, with a picture of a whale.
Remember – I'll be watching you.

Regards,
Santa "All-seeing" Claus
